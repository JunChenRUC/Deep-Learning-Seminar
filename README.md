## Deep Learning Seminar

The Deep Learning Seminar is for both graduate and undergraduate students that have special interests on Deep Learning (DL). In this seminar series, the students will collaborate in an intensive examination of topics related to understanding the basic concepts, models and algorithms of DL. 

The basic module of the Deep Learning seminar is designed as a discussion seminar. Emphasis will be on close reading and discussion of the assigned readings. Each volunteer participant will be responsible for leading the seminar discussion on assigned weeks. All participants are expected to come prepared to discuss and debate the readings each week. Participants will develop their understanding of the material through class presentations and discussions.

An advanced module of source code review is designed for the participants that want to develop their skills on understanding the mathematical models (review model related code, e.g., equation implementation) and improving programming skills (mainly on the programming model, system architecture, etc). Emphasis will be on close reading and discussion of the DL model related code. In particular, this seminar will use Apache SINGA (http://singa.apache.org/), an open source DL platform for code review.
